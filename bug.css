The CSS specificity rules can be quite confusing and lead to unexpected styling issues when multiple selectors target the same element. For instance, consider this scenario:

```css
div p { color: blue; }
.special p { color: red; }

<div>
  <p class="special">This text should be red.</p>
</div>
```

In this case, the more specific selector `.special p` overrides `div p`, resulting in red text. However, understanding how specificity works across different selector types (id, class, element, etc.) requires careful consideration.
